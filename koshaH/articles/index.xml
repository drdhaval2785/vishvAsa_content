 Can someone kindly tell more about &amp;ldquo;Dravidian&amp;rdquo; words or hymns in Vedas?
 Anyway, while kumArila-bhaTTa speaks of drAviDa words in veda &amp;amp; gives examples of non-Arya (drAviDa &amp;amp; others) words, he doesn&amp;rsquo;t specify which word is from where.
Here is an excerpt from his commentary; towards the end, you can read, &amp;ldquo;tatheha pikanematAmarasAdi coditam&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;. The term &amp;lsquo;coditam&amp;rsquo; indicates that those words (pika, nema, tAmarasa, etc) are found in the veda.</description>

      <description>PREFACE. When already there are some Sanskrit-English Dictionaries in the field, it becomes necessary to explain, at the outset, the necessity for the production of such a volume as the one now offered to the public. Of the Sanskrit-English Dictionaries, now in existence, none was written specially to meet the wants of Indian students and none is within the easy reach of the student of moderate means. Professor Goldstücker’s excellent but voluminous lexicon did not even reach the end of अ and is now out of print.</description>

      <title>Onomatopoeia</title>

My preference is to avoid modernisms and try to reuse existing words and word construction paradigms as much as possible. Especially if new coinages clash with established ones. For instance, हा हा has the established meaning of sorrow, so I would not use it in the book for laughter.
Most onomatopoeia in Sanskrit is outside of the main canon (Kalidasa, Bana etc.). The frequency is greater in Jaina literature and in authors like Rajashekhara who engaged with Prakrit.</description>

      <description>विस्तारः (द्रष्टुं नोद्यम्) DHH Ingalls observes one reason for this strength of Sanskrit
 Sanskrit not only has an enormous vocabulary; it has also a larger choice of synonyms than any other language I know. In a natural language there are probably no synonyms.
Of course, one can go to a thesaurus and find what are called synonyms. For the English word &amp;lsquo;house&amp;rsquo; one may find ‘dwelling,&amp;rsquo; ‘residence,&amp;rsquo; ‘tenement,&amp;rsquo; ‘abode,&amp;rsquo; and so on.</description>
