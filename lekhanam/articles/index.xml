I&amp;rsquo;m also a proponent of Roman transliteration instead of Devanāgarī́, because alphabets are superior (computationally &amp;amp;c.) to abugidas. If there were an Indian alphabet that were widely used, I&amp;rsquo;d use it instead of Latin, but I&amp;rsquo;m not aware of one that even exists let alone being widely used.
Conceptually: they write consonants and vowels separately, which constitute independent sounds not inherently connected to one another, rather than arbitrarily combining them.</description>

Devanāgarī&amp;rsquo;s supra-local status has historical roots in the early forms of Nāgarī and its prototypes were often used outside of north India, e.g. a script known as Nandī-nāgarī and other similar northern-style scripts were sporadically used in addition to the local scripts for writing Sanskrit in the Deccan / south India from the 7th century onwards.
Inscriptions in early or proto-forms of Nāgarī are also found outside of India, as far as Sri Lanka, Burma &amp;amp; Indonesia, and the scripts, from which Devanāgarī developed, became a sacred form of writing for Buddhists in East Asia.</description>
