At a very conservative estimate, there exist today some 3000 MSS of Bhart·πõhari. Most of these, being hidden away in private collections, will be destroyed unused by the action of time, air, rain, mice, white ants and all other vermin except scholars.
The greatest factor that prevents this material from becoming useful is the sloth and negligence of their owners, who rarely know what they possess but are even more rarely willing to have their collections examined.</description>

      <description>A young Sanskrit scholar used to wait patiently on the banks of a river on solar or lunar eclipse days or on festive days hoping that somebody would throw into the river rare and ancient Sanskrit manuscripts. It is the practice among some Hindu families to offer to the &amp;lsquo;Ganga&amp;rsquo; ancient scripts they have inherited if they felt they could no longer keep them or if there is any illness or difficulty in the house.</description>

Clerk asks for letter in triplicate from HoD attested by gazetted officer. You bring it back next day, but library unofficially shuts down on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
