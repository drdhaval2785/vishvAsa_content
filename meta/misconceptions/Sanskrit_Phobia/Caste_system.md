## Caste system reinforcement
> Claim: "Sanskrit literature reinforces the hindu caste system."

Why single out Sanskrit epics for this analysis? What about Hindi, Tamil, Kannada, Telugu epics that also reinforce that system? And some counter-religious bauddha and jaina texts? All ancient scholarship (irrespective of language and country), was to a huge degree, elite scholarship.

Why would you turn a blind eye to mountains of Sanskrit works (hindu, buddhist, jain) which talk nothing about caste or gender roles in a way you dislike?
