 Per his words in this video snippet: https://twitter.com/pvaal2/status/1301890398407856128
 Also interesting are his views at https://twitter.com/pvaal2/status/1301913079563812866 :
 &amp;ldquo;Inheritors of a past that they did not create themselves have an obligation to share it &amp;hellip; &amp;quot;

      <description>Bengal Historical Records William Adam&amp;rsquo;s observation (1838)
 &amp;ldquo;Sanscrit learning is to a certain extent, open to all classes of native society whom inclination, leisure, and the possession of adequate means may attract to its study, and beyond that limit it is confined to brahmans. The inferior castes may study grammar and lexicology, poetical and dramatic literature, rhetoric, astrology, and medicine; but law, the writings of the six schools of philosophy, and the sacred mythological poems, are the peculiar inheritance of the brahman caste&amp;rdquo;.</description>
