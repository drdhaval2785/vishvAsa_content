William Adam's observation (1838)  

> "Sanscrit learning is to a certain extent, open to all classes of native society whom inclination, leisure, and the possession of adequate means may attract to its study, and beyond that limit it is confined to brahmans. The inferior castes may study grammar and lexicology, poetical and dramatic literature, rhetoric, astrology, and medicine; but law, the writings of the six schools of philosophy, and the sacred mythological poems, are the peculiar inheritance of the brahman caste".

A change observed in the North Western provinces of Bengal presidency (1844)

> • "The study of the law and of the six schools of philosophy, which are the peculiar inheritance of the Brahmanical caste, is now neglected, while grammar, lexicology, poetical and dramatic literature, rhetoric, astrology and medicine, to which even Sudras were permitted access, are now monopolized by that caste."
