For a general account of vedic accents and their oral rendering one might refer to the following: vaidika svara-s.
The recitation of the R^igveda, the vulgate atharvaveda and kANva shAkha of the shukla yajur veda follow a generally similar pattern over much of bhArata-varSha. The nambuthiri-s of the chera country, especially while reciting the RV follow a highly derived set of rules that are encountered nowhere else. The widespread mAdhyaMdina-s and the Orissan paippalAda-s have largely lost the original svara-s and have only a pseudo-intoned recitation.</description>

A practical guide to Svaras in Vedic recitation
Vedic accents and their vocal rendering Udātta-s(U) are marked in red in this article. This is the natural or inherent accent in a word. Traditionally it is rendered as middle pitch. Udātta may be signaled especially in ṚV and AV traditions by raising the hand. Hence, Pāṇini’s sūtra on Udātta (उच्चैरुदात्तः - 1.2.29) originally meant that the arm was raised rather than the pitch being raised (as commonly understood by many).</description>
