      <description>In the previous chapter, I have discussed how the tradition has misinterpreted 1.4.2 vipratiṣedhe paraṁ kāryam. In this section, I lay the conceptual foundation that will help us understand the actual meaning of 1.4.2 in the next section (2.2).
Over a period of time, I studied different examples in which two vidhi sūtras ‘operational rules’ are simultaneously applicable at the same step of a derivation, from both traditional sources and modern literature.</description>

      <title>2 2 Solutions for Type 1 (SOI) and Type 2 (DOI)</title>

      <description>(R1A R2A →) A + B
Which one of the two rules R1A and R2A should we apply at this step? Pāṇini does not give us any explicit instructions about solving SOI. In my view, if two rules are applicable simultaneously to the same operand, the rule that is more specific, which we may call ‘the special or exception rule’, wins. Note that this is similar to the traditional notion that an apavāda ‘exception’ rule defeats an utsarga ‘general’ rule.</description>

      <title>2 3 Evidence for My Interpretation of Para</title>

      <description>Before going further, let me provide more evidence to support my interpretation of para. The meaning of para in 1.4.2 can be confirmed by looking at the meaning of para in the rest of the Aṣṭādhyāyī. The term para has been used by Pāṇini on many occasions. Its occurrences can be classified into two groups:
35
Group A: 1.1.34, 1.4.109, 3.2.39, 3.3.138, 3.4.20, 4.3.5, 5.2.92, 5.3.29, 6.3.8.2
Group B: 1.1.47, 1.</description>

      <title>2 4 A Key Difference Between SOI and DOI</title>
      <link>https://vishvAsa.github.io/sanskrit/vyAkaraNam/pANinIyam/paribhAShA/articles/vipratiShedhe_param/shabda-paratva-thesis_riShi-rAj-popat/02/2_4_A_Key_Difference_Between_SOI_and_DOI/</link>

      <description>SOI and DOI have one prominent feature in common: in case of both SOI and DOI, two (or more) rules are simultaneously applicable at a certain step of the derivation. However, it is important to shed light on a key difference between SOI and DOI. This difference between SOI and DOI pertains to whether or not they involve competition between two operands.

      <title>2 5 Pāṇinian and Post-Pāṇinian Approaches to Derivations</title>

      <description>In order to determine why post-Pāṇinian (both traditional and modern) scholars have misinterpreted Pāṇini’s rule 1.4.2, we need to understand that there is a fundamental difference between what I think are Pāṇinian1 and post-Pāṇinian conceptions of, or perspectives towards, the derivational procedure itself. I will explain exactly what I mean by this statement by means of examining six representative examples of SSRI from both Pāṇinian and post-Pāṇinian perspectives below.

      <description>Now let us look at how the tradition solves examples of conflict. As stated in the previous chapter, traditional scholars tried to use their interpretation of 1.4.2 (the rule that comes later in the serial order of the Aṣṭādhyāyī wins the conflict) to resolve such conflicts. This often gave them the wrong answer, so in order to reduce the challenges posed by their interpretation of 1.4.2, they significantly reduced the scope of applicability of 1.</description>

      <title>2 7 Examples of DOI</title>
      <link>https://vishvAsa.github.io/sanskrit/vyAkaraNam/pANinIyam/paribhAShA/articles/vipratiShedhe_param/shabda-paratva-thesis_riShi-rAj-popat/02/2_7_Examples_of_DOI/</link>

      <description>In my opinion, &amp;ldquo;1.4.2 vipratiṣedhe paraṁ kāryam&amp;rdquo; means: in the event of DOI, the RHS rule wins. As stated before, I have not used the term ‘rule conflict’ in my interpretation of 1.4.2. This is because I think that Pāṇini does not require us to use such a concept to understand 1.4.2, and consequently, to perform derivations correctly.
However, as shown above, all post-Pāṇinian discussion pertaining to 1.4.2 has focused on conflict.</description>

      <title>2 8 Examples of SOI</title>

      <description>Having discussed examples of DOI, I will now show, through the following examples, that my solution (i.e., the more specific rule wins) helps deal with cases of SOI. Note that we find very few examples of RE 5 (SOI non-conflict) in Pāṇinian derivations. These cases are neither particularly challenging nor of interest to the tradition. Thus, I will only discuss cases of conflict here. To avoid redundancy, I will refrain from reiterating or proving the existence of conflict in these examples.</description>
